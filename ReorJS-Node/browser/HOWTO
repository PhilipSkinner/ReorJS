== Browser client how-to ==

The browser client allows you to salvage CPU cycles from visitors on your
own website.

== How to configure ==

To get up and running straight away simply change the _domain attribute
inside the reor.js script to be the domain and port your are running your
ReorJSd service on, for example:

http://reorjs.com:9999

You can also specify the timeout (_timeout) between tasks being processed. This value
is in milliseconds. Please ensure that the timeout your set is not too small
and causes your users computers to slow down - remember they are giving you
something for nothing.

The _maxError attribute allows you to specify the maximum number of errors
communicating with the ReorJSd service. Once this number of errors has been
reached the script will no longer be called.

== How to embed ==

In order to ensure the best security for your users, it is best to include
the reorjs.html file inside an iframe:

<iframe src="http://yourwebsite.com/reorjs/reorjs.html" style="border: 0px;
margin: 0px; padding: 0px; width: 0px; height: 0px;"></iframe>

You can just embed the script straight into your website:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/reor.js"></script>

; though this is not recommended as other scripts on your page can influence
the reorjs browser client.

== Notification ==

You should notify your users that you are using ReorJS to process tasks on
their computers. We recommend including a small notification or graphic in
the footer of your website.
