Examples
=====

We have compiled a number of example applications that can be run on the ReorJS platform.

This list and the examples are under continous development.

1. Genetic algorithms

1.1 genetic-num-calc.js

This genetic algorithm calculates equations that equal the target number. It stores commands 
in 4 bits of a binary encoded DNA string and evaluates those string to calculate the fitness 
of a given DNA string in equaling the target number given.

This algorithm only carries out individual string mutation, no crossover mutation is carried 
out.
